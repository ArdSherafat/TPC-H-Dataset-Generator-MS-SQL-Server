# TPC-H Dataset Generator

TPC-H Data and Query Generator for Microsoft SQL Server on Linux. This repo was modified from version 2.18 of TPC-H benchmark. The modification is created with the purpose of introducing better support for loading this benchmark in Microsoft SQL on Linux.

## Getting started

### Loading the database from TPC-H
- Move to main directory for generation related operations:
 
 ```
 cd dbgen
 ```

- Compile the necessary object and executable files:
 
```
make
```

- Generate the data. Choose the scale factor you want for the data. TPC-H runs are only compliant when run against SF's 
      of 1, 10, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, 10000, 30000, 100000. If you want more option, try to take a look at dbgen/README:

```
./dbgen -s <scale>
```

After that, the bulk file will be created under the extension of .tbl.

- Create the schema and load the data into the database. Remember to modify the path of the .tbl files at the end of this sql script before running it. Supply the username and password of your database into \<username\> and \<password\>:

```
sqlcmd -S <server_ip> -U <username> -P <password> -i schema/tpch.sql
```

- Create primary keys and foreign keys. If you ran into errors such as not being able create primary key on nullable column, you could try looking inside the script and running the lines involving altering the columns for primary key to NOT NULL:

```
sqlcmd -S <server_ip> -U <username> -P <password> -i schema/tpch_fk.sql
```
- In case you need to start or stop the MSSQL Service, use `bash start_mssql.sh` and `bash stop_mssql.sh`

### Generating the queries
```
Set the environmant variable to one of
export DSS_QUERY=./queries_filtered_0
export DSS_QUERY=./queries_filtered_1
export DSS_QUERY=./queries_filtered_2
export DSS_QUERY=./queries_filtered_original
export DSS_QUERY=./queries_filtered_simplified
cd ..
python3 gen_queries.py -U <db admin> -P <password> --num_queries <number of queries per template> --test_split <the percentage of templates to use in test set>
```
The result is stored in `dbgen/generated_queries`

Note that I am using these templates to generate showplan, so if you do not want to use showplan, you can remove
```
set showplan_all on;
go
```
in each template sql file in `dbgen/queries/`
